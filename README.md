# Data Structures & Algorithms File Structure for Code 401: Java

This repo shows the expected file structure for Code 401: Java data structures & algorithms. The command `gradle init --type java-library` was run inside of the `code401challenges` directory, and that `code401challenges` directory is the root from which I open IntelliJ.

This root README is where the links to daily work live.

  #### Challenge Description
  Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.
  
  #### Approach & Efficiency
  We took the iterate through and replace approach. We have not covered Big O time yet.
